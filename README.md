# Numerical-Methods-mini-project
The task involves implementing a MATLAB function that calculates the product of the norm of a square matrix and the norm of its inverse, given that the matrix is a square, invertible Hessenberg matrix. The purpose of the function is to verify a mathematical theorem and measure the condition number of the matrix.
